# lorem-ipsum

This is a simple React app that generates Lorem Ipsum paragraphs based on user input. 
It uses VITE as a build tool and nanoid for generating unique IDs.

### Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository and run it locally on your machine. First, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:
`npm install`

Then, start the development server:
`npm run dev`

This will start the app on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Usage
Once the app is running, you can use the input field to specify how many paragraphs of Lorem Ipsum you want to generate. The app will generate a new set of paragraphs every time you change the input value.
